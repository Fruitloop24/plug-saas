### What Makes This Different

**1. JWT as Single Source of Truth**

Traditional SaaS: `Request → Verify auth → Query DB for plan → Check limits → Process`

This template: `Request → Verify JWT (plan included) → Check limits → Process`

**No database lookups.** The user's subscription tier is embedded in their JWT. When they upgrade, Stripe webhooks update Clerk metadata, and the next JWT automatically includes the new plan.

**📖 Deep dive:** [Architecture Guide](https://github.com/Fruitloop24/clerk/blob/master/docs/features/architecture.md)

**2. Edge-Native Architecture**

Your API runs globally, not in a single region. Cloudflare deploys your code to 300+ cities. Users in Tokyo, London, and New York all get ~50ms response times.

**Zero cold starts.** No Lambda spin-up delays. Always-on Workers.

**3. No Database Until You Need One**

- **User identity** → Clerk stores it
- **Subscription status** → Stripe stores it
- **Usage counters** → Cloudflare KV (key-value store)

You only add a database when YOU need to store YOUR app's data (documents, files, posts, etc.). Not for auth/billing infrastructure.

### Drop Your App Behind It

This template provides the **infrastructure layer:**
- ✅ User sign-up and authentication
- ✅ Subscription checkout and management
- ✅ Usage tracking and tier enforcement
- ✅ JWT routing to protect endpoints

**You provide the product logic:**
- AI document processing? Plug it in.
- Image generation API? Drop it behind the auth layer.
- Analytics dashboard? Protected routes ready.
- Whatever you're building? The separation is clean.

**Example integration:**
```typescript
// api/src/index.ts - Add your endpoint

if (url.pathname === '/api/your-feature' && request.method === 'POST') {
  // JWT already verified, userId and plan available
  // Tier limits already checked

  // YOUR CODE HERE
  const result = await yourBusinessLogic(userId, plan);

  // Usage automatically tracked
  return new Response(JSON.stringify({ result }), { status: 200 });
}
```

The JWT, usage tracking, and tier enforcement are already wired up. You write the features.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- **Node.js 20+** installed
- **Wrangler CLI** - Cloudflare's deployment tool: `npm install -g wrangler`
- **Stripe CLI** - For webhook testing: [Install guide](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli#install)
- **Accounts created** (all free to start):
  - Cloudflare account (free tier)
  - Clerk account (free up to 10k users)
  - Stripe account (test mode)

### 1. Clone & Install

```bash
git clone <your-repo>
cd clerk

# Install backend dependencies
cd api && npm install

# Install frontend dependencies
cd ../frontend-v2 && npm install
```

### 2. Set Up Clerk Authentication

Clerk handles all user authentication and JWT tokens for this application.

**📖 Follow the detailed setup guide:** [Clerk Setup Guide](https://github.com/Fruitloop24/clerk/blob/master/docs/platforms/clerk.md)

This guide will walk you through:
- Creating your Clerk application
- Setting up the JWT template (required for tier system)
- Getting your API keys

**✅ When complete, you should have:**

Copy the example files and fill in your Clerk keys:
```bash
# Backend
cp api/.dev.vars.example api/.dev.vars

# Frontend
cp frontend-v2/.env.example frontend-v2/.env
```

**📋 See complete examples:** [Backend .dev.vars](https://github.com/Fruitloop24/clerk/blob/master/docs/sample-files/backend-dev-vars-example.md) | [Frontend .env](https://github.com/Fruitloop24/clerk/blob/master/docs/sample-files/frontend-env-example.md)

Your `api/.dev.vars` should look like this:
```bash
# Clerk Configuration
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_abc123...      # From Clerk Dashboard
CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_xyz789... # From Clerk Dashboard
CLERK_JWT_TEMPLATE=pan-api              # Exact value (must match template name)

```

Your `frontend-v2/.env` should look like this:
```bash
# Clerk Configuration
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_xyz789... # Same as above
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8787           # Local backend URL
```

### 3. Set Up Stripe Payments

Stripe handles all payment processing and subscription billing for this application.

**📖 Follow the detailed setup guide:** [Stripe Setup Guide](https://github.com/Fruitloop24/clerk/blob/master/docs/platforms/stripe.md)

This guide will walk you through:
- Getting your Stripe API keys
- Creating products for each paid tier (Pro, Enterprise, etc.)
- Setting up the Customer Portal for subscription management
- Getting your Price IDs and Portal Configuration ID

**📋 See complete backend config:** [Backend .dev.vars Example](https://github.com/Fruitloop24/clerk/blob/master/docs/sample-files/backend-dev-vars-example.md)

**✅ When complete, you should have:**

Your `api/.dev.vars` should now look like this:
```bash
# Clerk Configuration (from Step 2)
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_abc123...
CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_xyz789...
CLERK_JWT_TEMPLATE=pan-api

# Stripe Configuration
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_def456...           # From Stripe Dashboard
STRIPE_PRICE_ID_PRO=price_1Abc23DEfg45HIjk    # Pro tier product price ID

# Add a STRIPE_PRICE_ID for each paid tier you created in Stripe
# The variable name should match whatever you named your tiers/products
STRIPE_PRICE_ID_ENTERPRISE=price_1Xyz98WVut76 # Enterprise tier product price ID (if applicable)

STRIPE_PORTAL_CONFIG_ID=bpc_1SK6M             # For customer subscription management
```

### 4. Configure Your Pricing Tiers (Optional)

The default template provides a complete multi-tier system (Free, Pro, Enterprise) with frontend routes, pricing cards, and backend enforcement. You can easily customize this using natural language with any AI CLI.

**🤖 Use the `/configure-tiers` Command (Recommended - works best with Claude Code)**

```
/configure-tiers
```

Works with Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, or DeepSeek. Or manually call `.claude/commands/configure-tiers.md` with your AI tool.

Answer questions about your tiers (name, price, limit, features), and it updates:
- ✅ Backend tier limits and Stripe integration
- ✅ Frontend pricing cards and routes
- ✅ Dashboard tier displays
- ✅ Environment variables

Modify everything in natural language to fit your product.

**📝 Manual Configuration**

Prefer manual control? Follow the [Manual Tier Setup Guide](https://github.com/Fruitloop24/clerk/blob/master/docs/sample-files/manual-tier-setup.md) for step-by-step instructions on updating each file.

---

### 5. Run Locally (3 Terminals)

**Terminal 1 - Backend:**
```bash
cd api && npm run dev
# http://localhost:8787
```

**Terminal 2 - Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend-v2 && npm run dev
# http://localhost:5173
```

**Terminal 3 - Stripe Webhooks:**
```bash
stripe listen --forward-to http://localhost:8787/webhook/stripe
# Copy whsec_... to api/.dev.vars and restart Terminal 1
```

### 5. Test End-to-End

1. Open http://localhost:5173
2. Sign up with email
3. Make 5 free requests (hit the limit)
4. Click "Upgrade to Pro"
5. Use test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
6. Verify unlimited access after refresh

**It works!** 🎉

---

## Deploy to Production

Once local development is working, you're ready to deploy your SaaS to production.

### 6. Deploy Backend API (Cloudflare Workers)

Your backend API will run on Cloudflare's global edge network (300+ cities worldwide) with ~50ms response times.

**📖 Follow the detailed deployment guide:** [Cloudflare Workers Deployment](docs/deployments/cloudflare.md)

This guide will walk you through:
- Authenticating with Cloudflare

- Adding the webhook signing secret to your worker
- Testing webhook delivery and the full upgrade flow

**✅ When complete, you'll have:**
- All products recreated in Stripe live mode with correct metadata
- Live Stripe keys and Price IDs configured in your worker
- Production webhook endpoint pointing to your API
- Real-time subscription updates working (upgrade/downgrade/cancel)

---

### 8. Deploy Frontend

Deploy your React frontend to Cloudflare Pages so users can access your SaaS from anywhere in the world with fast load times.

**📖 Follow the detailed deployment guide:** [Cloudflare Pages Frontend Deployment](https://github.com/Fruitloop24/clerk/blob/master/docs/deployments/frontend-deploy.md)

This guide will walk you through:
- Pushing your code to GitHub and connecting your repository

## Cost Breakdown

**$0/month until 10,000+ users. Then ~$31/month. At 100k users: ~$109/month.**

Compare that to typical SaaS stacks costing $75-150/month from day one.

**📖 See the complete cost analysis:** [Cost Breakdown & Comparison](https://github.com/Fruitloop24/clerk/blob/master/docs/features/cost-breakdown.md)

This guide includes:
- Detailed cost breakdown at every scale (0-100k+ users)
- What triggers each cost increase (so you can forecast)
- Comparisons to other stacks (Vercel, AWS, Firebase, other SaaS templates)
- Cost optimization strategies (batch operations, caching, aggregation)
- Real-world cost projections with revenue scenarios
- Hidden costs you avoid (database maintenance, CDN, SSL, monitoring)

**TL;DR:** Infrastructure costs ~3% of revenue instead of 15%. More money for building your product.
